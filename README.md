<h2> ðŸ¦¦ About Me: </h2>

I am a time traveling viking born on St. Patrick's Day as the son of a clown.

Yes, it's actually true... from a certain point of view. Let's break it down a bit.

<h3> Time Traveler </h3>
In early 2014 I was blessed to attend a friend's wedding in New Zealand. On my way back I crossed the International Date Line, and if you hit it at exactly the right time you can actually travel forward more than 24 hours. My flight happend to be at a time that hit it just right, so that Feb 1st 2014 didn't exist for me. I skipped from very late in the evening on Friday January 31st to very early in the morning on Sunday February 2nd. I am a time traveler.

<h3> Viking </h3>
With a name like Hanson, you know that I've got a lot of Swedish hertiage in me. I took it one step further and joined a Norse-themed club called Valhalla's Gates. It was me (a pasty white nerd) and a bunch of burly bikers. We had a clubhouse with axe-throwing lanes, a combat area for swordfighting, and even a forge!

<h3> St. Patrick's Day</h3>
Yup, that's by birthday: March 17th.

<h3> Son of a Clown </h3>
I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but my father had two professions as I was growing up: farmer and clown. He would plant beans and corn, haul irrigation pipe around, drive a truck or combine at harvest... and occasionally make baloon animals and do magic tricks at birthday parties. When people discover that my father was a clown they tend to tell me that it makes a lot of sense why I turned out the way I did.

Not sure if that's a compilment or not...
